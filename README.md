# Charlie_the_virtual_assistant

Charlie is a virtual assistant I designed for my hostel room. Charlie would greet me and my roommates good morning. He recognises our face and takes orders from us only.
He tells jokes, he tells time, he tosses coin, he does little things that another roommate would do. He is deployed on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with a webcam and continuously serves us.
